# Hash Table Library

## Abstraction

This library provides a back-end Hash Table for efficiently handling data insertion, querying, and deletion from the terminal.

## Summary

The primary objective of this program is to offer programmers a convenient header file containing a pre-built Hash Table, eliminating the need for manual code implementation. Similar to Object Oriented Programming's inheritance concept, this program functions as a parent class, allowing users to utilize all methods (in C, functions) without delving into the underlying mechanics. Adopting the principles of "information hiding," the code exposes only the essential information needed for utilizing the provided tools, keeping implementation details concealed within the code library.

## Algorithms

The library supports three algorithms:

1. **Hash by Length:**
   - Performance: Generally poor.
   - Description: The algorithms return value is the dataÂ´s length size. Collisions are inevitable due to the      key's length being much smaller than the table size.

2. **Hash by Sum:**
   - Performance: Generally efficient.
   - Description: The algorithm sums all bytes and then calculates the modulus by the table size, providing a well-distributed hash value.

3. **Hash by XOR:**
   - Performance: Similar to hash by sum.
   - Description: This algorithm involves summing byte values, applying bitwise XOR to flip bits, resulting in a less predictable hash value. While similar in cost to hash by sum, it adds a layer of complexity to the key.

## Testing

To test the Hash Table, use the following command line arguments:

```bash
./a3 -n 240 -H sum -P qua -p data-byname.txt
```
or 

```bash
./a3 -p -n 200 -H sum -d deletefile.txt -q querybyname.txt -P qua ./data-byname.txt
```

For additional information on command line arguments, type:
```bash
./a3 -h
```

| xor   | Insertion: 221, Search: 0, Deletion: 0 |
